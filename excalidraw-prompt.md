| **Prompt**              | **Description**                                                                                      | **Sample Description**                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Mind Map**         | Create a mind map of your favorite hobbies. Start with a central idea (e.g., "Hobbies") and branch out into specific activities (e.g., "Sports," "Art," "Music"). Add sub-branches for details like "Soccer," "Painting," or "Guitar." Use different colors or icons to make it visually engaging. | **Sample**: A central circle labeled "Hobbies" in blue, with three main branches in red, green, and yellow labeled "Sports," "Art," and "Music." "Sports" has sub-branches like "Soccer" (with a soccer ball icon) and "Tennis." "Art" branches into "Painting" (with a paintbrush icon). Lines connect everything, with playful doodles like stars around the edges. |
| **2. Flowchart**        | Design a flowchart for a simple decision-making process, such as choosing what to eat for dinner. Include decision points (e.g., "Vegetarian?") and outcomes (e.g., "Pasta" or "Stir-fry"). Use arrows to connect the steps logically. | **Sample**: A rectangular "Start" box, leading to a diamond labeled "Vegetarian?" with "Yes" and "No" arrows. "Yes" goes to "Pasta," "No" splits to "Chicken" or "Stir-fry." Each outcome is in a green box, connected by black arrows, with a tiny fork icon next to "Pasta." |
| **3. Timeline**         | Illustrate a timeline of major events in your life. Use a horizontal line with markers for each event (e.g., "Graduation," "First Job," "Moved to a New City"). Add small icons or drawings to represent each milestone and label them with dates or ages. | **Sample**: A straight horizontal line with dots at intervals. At "2018," a graduation cap icon with "Graduation." At "2020," a briefcase for "First Job." At "2022," a house for "Moved to New City." Each dot has a year label and a small sketch, connected by a dashed line. |
| **4. Infographic**      | Make an infographic about the benefits of drinking water. Include sections like "Health Benefits," "Daily Recommendations," and "Fun Facts." Use icons (e.g., water drops, human figures) and simple charts to visualize statistics or data. | **Sample**: A title "Why Drink Water?" at the top. Below, a water drop icon next to "Health Benefits" (e.g., "Clear Skin"). A pie chart shows "8 cups/day" recommendation. "Fun Facts" has a trivia bubble: "70% of your body is water!" Blue accents throughout. |
| **5. Comic Strip**      | Draw a short comic strip telling a funny story or joke. Create 3-4 panels with characters, speech bubbles, and simple backgrounds. Focus on a clear beginning, middle, and punchline. | **Sample**: Three panels. Panel 1: A stick figure says, "I’m great at multitasking!" Panel 2: They juggle a phone, coffee, and a cat. Panel 3: Coffee spills, cat runs, and they yell, "Never mind!" Simple background with a table and scribbled mess. |
| **6. Logo Design**      | Sketch a logo for a fictional company or product. Think of a concept (e.g., a tech startup, a bakery) and incorporate relevant symbols or imagery (e.g., a rocket for tech, a cupcake for a bakery). Keep it simple and memorable. | **Sample**: For "RocketTech," a sleek rocket tilted upward, with a curved line forming a "T" at its base. Done in bold black and orange, with a minimalist star above the rocket tip. Clean and sharp for a tech vibe. |
| **7. Architectural Sketch** | Create a simple sketch of your dream house. Include basic floor plans (e.g., rooms, doors, windows) and an exterior view. Add details like furniture or landscaping to bring it to life. | **Sample**: A rectangular floor plan with "Living Room" (couch sketch), "Kitchen" (sink icon), and "Bedroom" (bed). Exterior view shows a house with a slanted roof, two windows, and a tree outside. Drawn in brown and green tones. |
| **8. Character Design** | Design a character for a story or game. Draw the character in different poses (e.g., standing, waving) and include various facial expressions (e.g., happy, surprised). Add notes on their personality or backstory if you like. | **Sample**: A quirky robot character. Standing pose with a square head and antenna. Waving pose with a big smile (circle eyes). Surprised pose with wide eyes and a "!" above. Notes say: "Friendly, loves fixing things." Red and gray color scheme. |
| **9. Data Visualization** | Visualize a dataset, such as the number of hours you spend on different activities each day (e.g., work, exercise, leisure). Use bar graphs, pie charts, or line graphs to represent the data clearly. Label each section for clarity. | **Sample**: A pie chart with "Work" (8 hrs, blue), "Exercise" (1 hr, green), "Leisure" (4 hrs, yellow), and "Sleep" (7 hrs, purple). Each slice labeled with hours and a percentage, with tiny icons (e.g., a dumbbell for exercise) next to each. |
| **10. Abstract Art**    | Create an abstract drawing using shapes, lines, and colors to express a mood or emotion (e.g., joy, calm, chaos). Experiment with overlapping shapes, gradients, or patterns without worrying about realism. Let your creativity flow! | **Sample**: Overlapping circles in bright yellow and orange for "Joy," with wavy blue lines cutting through. Random pink triangles scatter around, and a green squiggle loops in the corner. No clear subject—just vibrant energy! |
